# `updaug`: TensorFlow implementation of DAugNetThis repository contains a TensorFlow implementation of the unsupervised domain-adaptation model in ["DAugNet: Unsupervised, Multi-source, Multi-target, and Life-long Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation of Satellite Images"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06216) by Tasar *et al*.## What you need to get started* A list of paths to image files* A list of integers mapping each image to a domain. Expects domains to be numbered 0 to `num_domains-1`* Corrresponding lists of images/domains for out-of-sample testing## Usage```pythonimport updauglogdir = "/path/to/where/model/and/logs/should/be/stored/"trainer = updaug.Trainer(trainfiles,                            trainlabels,                            testfiles,                            testlabels,                            filetype="png",                            imshape=(128,128),                            batch_size=32,                            lr=1e-4                            lr_decay=100000,                            num_parallel_calls=4)trainer.fit(100)```Both generator and discriminator will be saved in the log diredctory, as well as TensorBoard logs recording all of the loss components over time, autoencoder reconstruction loss on the out-of-sample dataset, and a visualization showing how a set of test images are mapped between domains.
